> Bucklescript bindings to react-navigation

Many thanks to [@saschatimme](https://github.com/saschatimme) who started work on bindings to react-navigation in the first place.

### Disclaimer

This is **work in progress**.

## Developing

```sh
# Starts Metro (React Native Packager)
yarn start-example

# Watches for source build changes
yarn start

# Runs the app on iOS/Android
yarn run-ios # run-android
```

If you experience problems with running iOS app from terminal, try using XCode. This may help in some cases.
